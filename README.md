A ROS wrapper to communicate via ROS services to start execution of data recording scripts and data storing scripts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequesites
This package is part of the [CNS Flight Stack] and thus depends on the other packages of the flight stack:
- [CNS Flight Stack: Autonomy Engine]
- [CNS Flight Stack: Nodelet Rosbag]

Further the following libraries are required
- Eigen
- ROS noetic

### Build

As this is a ROS package, please build it within the catkin environment with

```bash
catkin build data_recorder
```

## Usage
The intended usage is together with the [CNS Flight Stack: Autonomy Engine], which will interact with the data recorder. Use the provided launchfile to start the ROS1 node

```bash
roslaunch data_recorder recorder.launch
```

### Recording scripts
The main goal of this node is to execute several scripts, i) to start data recording, ii) to stop data recording, and iii) to store the recorded data.

- i) is executed when a recording start request is received and is most likely to call the [CNS Flight Stack: Nodelet Rosbag], the arguments given in `record_cmd` are passed to this script
- ii) is executed when a recording stop is received, typically killing all nodes starting with `/record_`
- iii) is executed after (ii) and can be used to move the recorded data (assuming several storage locations) to a final (external) device; the arguments given in `store_cmd` are passed to this script

For a sample configuration of these scripts please take a look at the scripts provided in [CNS Flight Stack Scripts].

### ROS Parameters
This node uses the following parameters that can be set in any launch file.

| ROS parameter | description | default value |
|:-------------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| `record_script` | path to the record script which is executed to start the recording       | ` `     |
| `record_cmd`    | arguments passed to the record script                                    | ` `     |
| `record_stop`   | path to the record stop script which is executed to stop the recording   | ` `     |
| `store_script`  | path to the record script which is executed to store the data afterwards | ` `     |
| `store_cmd`     | arguments passed to the store script                                     | ` `     |
| `verbose`       | flag to display debug output                                             | `False` |

### Default Launchfile Parameters

These are the same as the ROS parameters, so only their default value is given.

| Launch parameter | default value                  |
|:----------------:|:------------------------------:|
| `record_script` | `<path_to_data_recorder>/scripts/record.sh` (_dummy script_) |
| `record_cmd`    | `dev1_full` |
| `record_stop`   | `<path_to_data_recorder>/scripts/record_stop.sh` (_generic script to stop all nodes starting with `/record_`_) |
| `store_script`  | `<path_to_data_recorder>/scripts/store.sh` (_dummy script_) |
| `store_cmd`     | ` ` |
| `verbose`       | `false` |

### Usage without Autonomy Engine

If required the detector can be used without the [CNS FlightStack: Autonomy Engine]. You can interact with the detector using the provided ROS service ROS Service `/data_recorder/record` using the
[`std_srvs/SetBool`](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/std_srvs/html/srv/SetBool.html).
The request is interpreted as follows

- `data=true`: start recording (or do nothing if already recording)
- `data=false`: stop recording (or do nothing if already stopped)

The response is `success` is set to `true` if the operation was successful (or mode was already selected).
If any failure occured (script not found, process could not be started, ...) the response is set to `false`.
Further, the `message` filed contains a minor debug information on the recording status.

An example execution looks like

```bash
rosservice call /data_recorder/record "data: false"
# Feedback:
success: true|false
message: "START: ..."|"STOP: ..."
```

## Architecture

Please refer to the academic paper for further insights of the Data Recorder.
